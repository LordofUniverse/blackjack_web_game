## HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:
### HOW POINTS ARE COUNTED
        
    Cards from 2-9 are at face-value (Have the points = to the number on them)
    J,Q,K get 10 points each
    A can be either 1 or 11 points based upon the situation.
    A should be taken as 11. If the sum of numbers exceed 21, you can take A to be 1.

### HOW CARDS ARE DEALT
    The dealer and the player both get 2 cards at random
    One of the dealer's card is shown, but the other is hidden
    The player needs to decide if they will stay with their 2 cards, or draw another one
    Same goes for the dealer

### OBJECTIVE
    The game is won by whichever person has the points closest to 21, but not exceeding it.
    In case it is exceeding 21, then the person gets busted (lost the round)

## Features:
    Images once loaded, will be saved into cache. So, the images will get loaded quick after loading once.
    I have purposely added 2 seconds delay after winning or losing or tie so that u could see the card before moving to the next game.
    The only library that has been used here is Bootstrap
